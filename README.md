# Hangman Game in Python



This is a classic Hangman game written in Python. 



**Description:**



Test your word-guessing skills in this fun Hangman game. You'll have a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Use only lowercase letters and be careful - each wrong guess brings you closer to losing the game!



**How to Play:**



* You start with 6 lives.

* Guess a letter at a time (lowercase only).

* If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.

* If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life.

* The game continues until you guess the entire word or run out of lives.



**Running the Game:**



1. Download the entire project folder from GitHub.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Open a terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the downloaded folder.

4. Run the script using the following command: `python hangman.py`



**Words List:**
